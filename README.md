Reflecting on the Artemis Financial Project   

Since Artemis Financial provides banking services they have to have a secure online platform. Our job was to use tools like Maven to make the Java code safe. This will help the company comply with financial regulations. More importantly it can prevent security breaches that will keep Artemis out of hot water. 

Running dependency checks was one of the more complex parts of this project. Understanding what to do with those vulnerabilities took extra time and research. This time was worth it to ensure the software is secure. Signed certificates and cipher algorithms were added for extra layers of security. 

When developing full stack applications it’s important to create secure applications. Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. By showing them Project Two I can prove my experience with testing a variety of Java libraries. Using Maven is a marketable skill to have in a developer’s portfolio.
